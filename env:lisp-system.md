% Choosing Your Lisp
%

Common Lisp implementations usually are called "systems", and there
are a number for the expert to choose from; this author will make
recommendations for the novice.

Open Source
---

Without an IDE, [CLISP](http://www.clisp.org) is the best to choose
from, due to its friendly arrow key usability.

Using emacs as an IDE, [SBCL](http://sbcl.org) (Steel Bank Common
Lisp) is the most popular choice at this point in time. Other common
systems are CCL (Clozure Common Lisp), CLISP, ABCL (Armed Bear Common
Lisp) and ECL (Embeddable Common Lisp). Less common systems
exist. This author recommends _SBCL_ for beginners who are comfortable
on the command line, but would like to point out that each Lisp system
provides value within the general Common Lisp ecosystem.


Commercial
---

LispWorks and Allegro are the currently maintained commercial
implementations (as well as IDEs). They provide free
limited-functionality personal editions with an IDE. This author has
had good experiences with LispWorks.
