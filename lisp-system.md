Common Lisp Implementation
=====

Common Lisp implementations usually are called "systems", and there
are a number for the expert to choose from.

Open Source
---

Without an IDE, CLisp is the best to choose from, due to its friendly
arrow key usability.

With an IDE, SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) is the popular choice at
this point in time. Other common systems are CCL (Clozure Common
Lisp), CLISP, ABCL and ECL. Less common systems exist. This project
recommends _SBCL_ for beginners, but recognizes that each Lisp system
provides value within the general Common Lisp ecosystem.


Commercial
---

LispWorks and Allegro are the currently maintained commercial
implementations (as well as IDEs). They provide free
limited-functionality personal editions with an IDE.
