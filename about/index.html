<h1>Who runs this?</h1>

<p>articulate-lisp.com is designed to fill a gap in the current
(2012-2015) resources for getting started with Common Lisp. It's the
work of mostly one person (Paul Nathan) so far, and represents his
best efforts and knowledge at this point in time.</p>

<p>In particular, the style and idioms should not be taken as some
mythical best practice, only what has worked for the author in the
past.</p>

<p>Feedback of all sorts will be gratefully welcomed. Contributions and
bug reports should be done via the 
<a href="https://github.com/pnathan/articulate-common-lisp">Github</a> location for maximum
coordination.</p>

<p><em>Happy hacking!</em></p>
