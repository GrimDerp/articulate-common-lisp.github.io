<h1 class="title">Emacs</h1>
</header>
<p>Emacs is <em>the</em> modern open source Lisp IDE. Its history and
quirks extend back to the Lisp machines and early editors such as
TECO.</p>

<p>It is considered difficult to initially learn, and often disparaged
due to the antiquated interface, but is generally thought the best
open source free IDE for Common Lisp.</p>

<p>In order to use emacs, there are two variants; XEmacs and GNU
Emacs. I usually use GNU emacs, so I&#8217;ll talk about it here.</p>

<p>In order to get it, you can obtain it from
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU</a>. Windows,
Linux, and OSX versions are available. It&#8217;s also available via
most Linux distributions package repositories. The most recent version
is 24; 23 is also recent and works well with the Superior Lisp
Interaction Mode for Emacs, a.k.a SLIME.</p>

<p>New users can find many resources online for Emacs, including a
well-written help system! An emacs tutorial can be
found <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html">here</a>,
and the GNU FAQ is
also <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-faq.text">available</a></p>

<p>Usually you want to get SLIME installed for your development.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re using emacs23, SLIME can be found <a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/project/slime/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Emacs24 has it in its package manager (<code>M-x package-list-packages</code>).</p>

<p>I like to use the following elisp to configure SLIME:</p>

<pre><code>(require &#39;cl)
(setq inferior-lisp-program  &quot;/usr/local/bin/sbcl&quot;) ;modify to taste
(require &#39;slime)
(slime-setup &#39;(slime-fancy))    ;adds some nice features

;; these give you unicode
(set-language-environment &quot;UTF-8&quot;)
(setenv &quot;LC_LOCALE&quot; &quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;)
(setenv &quot;LC_CTYPE&quot; &quot;en_US.UTF-8&quot;)
(setq slime-net-coding-system &#39;utf-8-unix)</code></pre>
<p>Another useful tool is:</p>
<pre><code>;; highlight parens
(require &#39;paren)
(show-paren-mode t)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="once-you-are-set-up">Once you are set up&#8230;</h2>

<p>When you load a Lisp file and want to engage SLIME, <code>M-x
    slime</code> will do the trick.</p>

<p>Paredit is a popular Lisp editing mode that the engaged student
will hear about. The author recommends getting comfortable with emacs
and SLIME before using Paredit, it provides several automatic
  s-expression editing features that surprised him on first use.</p>

<p>When you have configured your SLIME in a <code>fancy</code>
fashion, you will find a SLIME REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) buffer
  created in your Emacs window.</p>

<p>This provides an interactive view into Common Lisp. You can
evaluate functions you are writing in the source file and immediately
use them in the REPL. This provides a very fast &#8220;code and
test&#8221; facility.</p>  <hr/>
