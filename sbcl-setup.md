Initial Environment Setup
====

Steel Back Common Lisp (SBCL) is aggressively maintained with releases
approximately monthly as of 2012. SBCL has a long history, with its
source code stretching back to the early '80s under different
names. This tutorial recommends SBCL due to its popularity at the time
of writing. Other opens source systems such as ECL, CLISP, CMUCL, and
CCL exist.

Installing on Linux and OSX
---

Linux is the "home OS" of SBCL. The installation procedure also works
the same easy for OSX. Typically the best way to start is to download
the binary from www.sbcl.org and install it.

The procedure for installing it on your system runs as so:

tar xjf <sbcl-binary>
cd sbcl-<version-name>
sudo make install


After that, execute sbcl at the command line and you should find the
REPL! Congratulations!

SBCL's REPL is designed to be used in an environment such as
emacs. Check the IDE help page for more information.
