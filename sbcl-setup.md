Initial Environment Setup

Steel Back Common Lisp (SBCL) is aggressively maintained with releases
approximately monthly as of 2012. SBCL has a long history, with its
source code stretching back to the early '80s under different
names. This tutorial recommends SBCL due to its popularity at the time
of writing. Other opens source systems such as ECL, CLISP, CMUCL, and
CCL exist.

Installing on Linux and OSX
---

Linux is the "home OS" of SBCL. The installation procedure also works
the same easy for OSX. Typically the best way to start is to download
the binary from www.sbcl.org and install it (The README is very
helpful).

After that, run sbcl and you should find the REPL! Congratulations!
