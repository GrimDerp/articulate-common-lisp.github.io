CUSP is an Eclipse plugin that should work with the standard Lisp IDE
interface (known as SWANK).

Unfortunately, it appears to be sadly out of maintenance.

The initial release was from
[bitfauna](http://bitfauna.com/projects/cusp/), then it was forked by
[Sergey Kolos](http://www.sergeykolos.com/cusp/update/index.html),
then he forked it again to create the Lispdev project, which
[again appears to be untouched](https://bitbucket.org/skolos/lispdev/overview).

Bug reports indicate that Kolos Cusp does not work with Windows 7 64-bit.
