<h1 class="title">Basic Project</h1>
</header>
<p>We are going to assume that your first project is a small standalone program using one of the common libraries for Common Lisp. Since Common Lisp is a general purpose high-level programming language, it can handle any common high-level language task.</p>
<p>Common libraries are installed using <a href="http://www.quicklisp.org/">Quicklisp</a>!</p>
<p>Go over there and install it, then come back to this tutorial.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume for the purpose of the starting project that you want to recursively walk a web server and take some action based upon the internal contents. We&#8217;ve supplied a minimal (not very robust or general) solution in <code>web-trotter.lisp</code>, available from <a href="src/web-trotter.lisp">our site</a>.</p>
<p>Without examining the details of the Trotter, notice that there&#8217;s a line:</p>
<p><code>(ql:quickload '(:drakma :split-sequence :cl-ppcre :babel))</code></p>
<p>This tells Quicklisp to ensure that the libraries DRAKMA, SPLIT-SEQUENCE, CL-PPCRE, and BABEL are loaded.</p>
<p>In your favorite IDE, load up web-trotter.lisp and execute <code>(run-trotter)</code>. It&#8217;ll wander around the CLIKI for a bit printing out the names of URLS it could visit.</p>
<p>The Trotter is a basic web crawler; some further work could produce a tool that would feed in the data to a database for searching.</p>
<p>Note that there is a lack of a main function. Lisp has no specified MAIN, unlike Java or C.</p>
