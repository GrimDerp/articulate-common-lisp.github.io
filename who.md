articulate-lisp.com is designed to fill a gap in the current (2012,
2013) resources for getting started with Common Lisp. It's the work of
one person (Paul Nathan) so far, and represents his best efforts and
knowledge at this point in time.

In particular, the style and idioms should not be taken as some
mythical best practice, only what has worked for the author in the
past.

Feedback of all sorts will be gratefully welcomed. Contributions and
bug reports should be done via the github location for maximum
coordination.

Happy hacking!
