*How to write Common Lisp in 2015 -   
an initiation manual for the uninitiated*

---

## Dear Reader,

One of the key problems in onboarding developers to use modern Common Lisp is the 
vertical wall of difficulty. Things that are routinely problematic:

*	emacs use. Most people don't use emacs.
*	Library creation. Putting together ASDF libraries and using them is a fairly
	horrid experience the first time.
*	Selection of Lisp system to use, along with an up-to-date discussion of pros
	and cons.
*	Putting together serious projects is not commonly discussed.

This site is dedicated to handling these problems. My goal is to put together an 
introduction/tutorial for practicing professionals and hobbyists from other 
languages. People who want to get started with Lisp beyond just typing into a REPL.
Right now, it feels like this information is less disseminated and much less 
centralized than it otherwise might be. It's not intended to be a HOWTO for Common
Lisp. That's been covered *quite well*. But it is intended to be a HOWTO on how to 
put together a Lisp **environment**.

Anyway, I'd like to collaborate with other people to make this a remarkably fine 
Lisp help site. Contributions are both **accepted** and **welcome**. It's a wholly 
static site at this point in time - I don't see a need for articulate-lisp.com to 
have a dynamic backend. Perhaps/probably one of the code examples will be a webapp.

Happy Hacking,

*Paul Nathan*
