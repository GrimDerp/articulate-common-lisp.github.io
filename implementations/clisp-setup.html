<h1>CLISP Setup</h1>
</header>

<p>The <a href="http://www.clisp.org">CLISP</a> Common Lisp implementation is a good 
general-purpose interpreter licensed under the terms of the GNU GPLv2. Though not as
popular as SBCL, it sports an intuitive user interface, a native compiler and an 
easy-to-use debugger. </p>

<p>It also includes various useful extensions to the official ANSI standard, such as 
foreign function calls and a socket interface. (Note however that using 
implementation-specific features binds one to the GPL.)</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/clisp">Download</a> one of the packages or 
pre-built binaries.</p>

<h3>Installing on Ubuntu</h3>

<p>On Ubuntu-based systems, you can install CLISP from the repositories:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install clisp
</code></pre>
