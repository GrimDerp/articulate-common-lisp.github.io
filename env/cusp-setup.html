<h1 class="title">CUSP</h1>
</header>
<p>CUSP is an Eclipse plugin that should work with the standard Lisp IDE interface (known as SWANK).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it appears to be sadly out of maintenance.</p>
<p>The initial release was from <a href="http://bitfauna.com/projects/cusp/">bitfauna</a>, then it was forked by <a href="http://www.sergeykolos.com/cusp/update/index.html">Sergey Kolos</a>, then he forked it again to create the Lispdev project, which <a href="https://bitbucket.org/skolos/lispdev/overview">again appears to be untouched</a>.</p>
<p>Bug reports indicate that Kolos Cusp does not work with Windows 7 64-bit.</p>
